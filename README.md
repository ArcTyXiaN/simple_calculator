 Simple Python Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly command-line calculator built using Python. It lets you perform basic arithmetic operations — like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and floor dividing two numbers. The best part? It runs in a loop, so you can keep calculating as long as you want, without restarting the program.

Features

- Accepts two numeric inputs and an arithmetic operator
- Supports five operations:  
  `+` for addition  
  `-` for subtraction  
  `*` for multiplication  
  `/` for division  
  `//` for floor division (removes decimal part)
- Prevents crashes by handling division by zero
- Accepts casual ways of saying "yes" like `yes`, `yo`, `yeah`, or `yep`
- Loops until the user clearly says they're done

 How to Use

Getting started is simple — no installations or external packages needed.

1. Clone this repository or copy the script into a `.py` file (e.g. `calculator.py`).
2. Open your terminal or command line.
3. Run the script with Python 3:
   python calculator.py

4. Enter two numbers when prompted.


5. Type the operator (+, -, *, /, //) to perform the calculation.


6. After each result, the program will ask if you want to perform another operation.
Type something like yes, yo, or yep to continue, or anything else to exit.

Sample Run

Enter num1: 8
Enter num2: 2
Enter operator (+, -, *, /, //): *
You entered 8 as num1, 2 as num2, and * as operator
Result: 16
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): yo
Running again...

File Overview

calculator.py – The main Python file that contains all the logic for the calculator.

 Requirements

Python 3.x
You can download it from python.org if you don’t have it installed already.

Why This Project Exists

This was created as a small learning project to help beginners:

Get familiar with Python syntax

Practice using if, elif, and else statements

Understand how loops and user input work

Learn basic error handling (like division by zero)


It’s simple, readable, and a good starting point for building more advanced command-line tools.

Where to Run It

Locally on your system using Python 3

On platforms like Replit, Codespaces, or any online Python interpreter


Let me know if you want setup help for those environments — easy to copy-paste and run!
