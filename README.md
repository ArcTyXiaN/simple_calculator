# simple_calculator
 A simple command-line calculator in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations in a continuous loop until the user decides to exit.

 Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic terminal calculator built with Python. It performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and floor division between two numbers. The calculator keeps running until the user decides to stop.


Features

- Takes two numbers and an operator from the user
- Supports:
  - `+` for addition  
  - `-` for subtraction  
  - `*` for multiplication  
  - `/` for division  
  - `//` for floor division
- Handles division by zero to prevent crashes
- Understands multiple ways of saying "yes" to continue (`yes`, `yo`, `yeah`, `yep`)
- Runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.


How to Use

1. Clone this repository or copy the script into a file named `calculator.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py

4. Follow the prompts:

-Enter two numbers

-Enter an operator

-View the result

-Choose whether to continue or exit


Sample Run

Enter num1: 8  
Enter num2: 2  
Enter operator (+, -, *, /, //): *  
You entered 8 as num1, 2 as num2, and * as operator  
Result: 16  
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): yo  
Running again...


File Overview

calculator.py â€” contains the full logic of the calculator.


Requirements

Python 3.x




Why This Project Exists

This was built as a practice project to learn how to:

Use if/elif/else conditions

Take and handle user input

Use loops effectively

Handle simple errors like division by zero

It's a simple and clean example for anyone learning Python basics through terminal projects.


Where You Can Run It

On your local machine with Python installed

On online Python editors like Replit, Codespaces, or any Python-supported environment
